# Default revoked Mycelium certificate fingerprints (Nebula `pki.blocklist`).
# Nebula has no revocation service: a certificate stays valid until it expires

  # `framie` (10.77.0.2), replaced by `framework` on 2026-09-27 when hosts moved
  # to the `peer` group. Its private key still exists, encrypted, in commit
  # 78de93aa4c8d of secrets/nebula-framework.yaml, which older clones retain.
